// This document will be used to make comments throughout this project for
// myself... the goal is to try and implement nested loops where the user
// will be given prompts scenario similar to that in the Matrix movie


// So using three different classes and methods I plan to use for the use of the the effect of each pill

// the blue pill will descibe more in detail of one's monotous life 
// .. compared to the illustrious effect while in the matrix that 
// .. may seem like a dream
// the red pill will lead you down the rabbit hole into the more complex
// .. side of the machine world as you are finally awakened into your
// .. true self 

// the general pill class will be an extension from both pills 

// methods include sideeffects of taking the color pill (cause,  effect)

// one of the pill classes will be given a private array list 
// in the main the, the user will be given options like if user picks the
// blue pill you will see an endless loop of a circle surrounding itself
// with the declartion of 'you are in an endless loop of work until you die'

// the 'else if' will be if user picks the red pill and the Matrix will begin by

// also in addition there will be a condition that is set if user picks 1 
// .. or the red pill they will 
// ... you taking out the plug that has been holding you back 

// there will also be an option for different color to see what happens with
// ... your life if you choose the right or wrong color

// another user input (if they choose) yes after picking the red pill

// at the end of the code add in a 3-d array where you loop through but print the code so they give random numbers similar to the matrix code rain

// this will be the exceptions example to base off of    try{
    //   dog.greet(dog2);
    // } catch (Exception ex) {
    //   System.out.println("caught!");
    //   ex.printStackTrace();

// Ultimate Plan For This Project Is This: 
// 1. The user will be asked if they want to find out more about freedom from Morpheus (choices are yes and no, if they say no there can be a loop that ends the entirety of the program but if they say yes then they will be led to the continuity of the matrix) 
// 2. When Morpheus asks user for which color pill they want they will have the choice to respond out of the two options (red or blue)
// 3. 
//   The user picks which color pill he wants (blue pill for reality and red pill to be apart of the matrix) 4. 
//   The sideeffects for both of the pills are different. The bluepill has the sideeffect of bringing the user back to reality (there could be an option asking the user what they do for work or do they like their normal life). If they like their normal life they have the option to decline the offer at first and then move and go back to reality. 
//   5. If they choose to pick the red pill the user will be directly effected because they will enter into the Matrix. The Matrix can be defined as a place where the reality is that the 'dream ' we are apart of is the computer controlled simulation but the Matrix is an escape from that in a city named Zion.

// 6. After choosing the red pill, user will be printed the benefits after entering the Matrix including powers of increased hearing, extra strength, extra jumping abliity, and have super human abilities. The user will ultimately see the effects like this "If you choose the red pill you will be set free, you will go to the city of Zion, you will have these listed powers"

// 7. If you go down this path (whether it be path one or path two all the effects will come after depending on the path you choose)

// 8. Add in encapsulation including the number for user's 'case number' meaning that they are 1 of x amount of people (use long data type in both paths)

// I deleted original version because I was getting frustrated with the progress and the complexity I was trying to do with it in the beginning. The more simplified versio of basically a receipt of the options will be the new output depending on the choice

// program will work that if user has entered the Matrix the Agent will detect and approach with a ray beam that deals damage

// In order for agents to know if someone is in the matrix they will detect the power level. If the power level is above 10 they will attack (this shows they are in the matrix) but if the power level is below 10 they will ignore the user

//  // for(int p = 0; p < positives.size(); p++){
